# Geeks Rule Bar Safari Extension
A Safari toolbar for the now-defunct tech blog Geeks Rule

From the post announcing its creation (https://geeksrule10.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/geeks-rule-safari-extension/):
There are links to the main Geeks Rule page and a random article. It also lists the most recent article, although you must visit the main website to give it the info. Once you do, the current windowâ€™s bar will include a link, and the others will once you reload them.
